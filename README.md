# Arduino-Car-Key-Jammer 🔑
# ❗ For Educational And Informational Purposes Only ❗
### What is that ???
> This is a small project about an RF module for an Arduino. This module can transmit at 433 MHz, which can be used to jam or disable a car key. This project is for educational and informational purposes only. In some countries, it is illegal to block a signal. I assume no liability for any damage.

### Does this work ❓
> Yes, it works, but not for every car, and 433 MHz is used in Europe, not in the USA (for the USA, it is 315 MHz or 868 & 915 MHz).
